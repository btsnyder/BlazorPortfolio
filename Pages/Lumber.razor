This information is then used to determine how much of the log can be used. It was our job to create an application that could calculate this data in real time and store it in an efficient manner. We deployed this as a Universal Windows Platform application so that it would be accessible with the hardware they would need. I was responsible for building the UI for this application, debugging any issues, developing feature requests, and increasing performance. Since this was being used in a production environment, it was critical that I understood the issues users were experiencing and provide a timely solution.",

This would allow us to update schemas as needed while still handling large volumes of data. I was tasked with building, deploying, and maintaining the database. Project owners would often have questions about data and it was my role to create the queries needed to provide the answer. Queries were also required for any changes to our data model that required updates to historical data, which I was responsible for writing."

While Couchbase offers their Sync Gateway to handle this, we still had to implement our own merge strategies for data integrity. I took the steps necessary to deploy the Sync Gateway and make it available to all users. I did this through the Google Cloud Platform . To keep the application secure, I integrated the Sync Gateway with Auth0. I diagnosed and worked through any issues that arose in our syncing process."

This was built in Xamarin Forms to allow for the most flexibility in our deployment environment. Similar to the log entry application, I was responsible for building the UI for this application, debugging any issues, developing feature requests, and increasing performance. To track the bugs and feature requests, I initiated our use of Jira to manage communication between the clients.",
