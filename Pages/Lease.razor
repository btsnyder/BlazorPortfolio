I built a Universal Windows Platform application, along with Auth0 to handle our authentication of the project. I was able to fully develop this application in a short amount of time due to my efficiency and drawing on previous knowledge. One of my favorite things as a programmer is when the code just flows and on this project that was the case.",

I had to create Excel worksheets from a UWP application, so it was critical that I understand how to translate that information. I enjoy learning new things, a trait that helps immensely when programming, so this was nothing too strenuous. It is always easier when there is good documentation on a topic. While in my earlier days, I tended to rely on StackOverflow, I have thankfully learned that when you need reliable information it is best to go directly to the source."
